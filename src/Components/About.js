      I am Everlyn Tisado, born on October 27, 2004. The family that I have consists of six members. I've got two sisters and one brother. One of my favorite things to do is to read e-books. I love cats and I actually own two, their names are Katkat and Kitkit. My favorite subject since I was in primary level is Mathematics. I love it when I got to compute and calculate numbers and successfully get the answers. The moment that I am writing this is my time of my third year level in college. Somehow, I am enjoying my college journey. I am rooting for the success of all students and survive on their own ways. With that, it was such an honour neeting you.
